Hi, I’m Diyuan Lu, a postdoctoral researcher at Helmholtz Center Munich, working at the intersection of machine learning and precision oncology.

My research focuses on using machine learning and deep learning to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical cancer data. I build models that learn predictive biomarkers from experimental datasets—such as cell lines and organoids—and evaluate how well these models can guide treatment decisions for real patients. 

Ultimately, my goal is to help build a future where every cancer patient receives therapy tailored to their individual biology, not based on trial-and-error, but guided by data. By connecting the lab bench and the clinic through AI, I aim to contribute to the long-term vision of truly personalized cancer care.
