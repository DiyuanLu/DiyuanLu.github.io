Hi, I’m Diyuan Lu, a postdoctoral researcher at Helmholtz Center Munich, working at the intersection of machine 
learning and precision medicine.

During my PhD at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies under Prof. Jochen Triesch(), I focused on developing 
machine learning methods for interpreting complex biosignals, particularly EEG data in neurological disorders. My 
work involved building deep learning models for tasks like anomaly detection and early-stage diagnosis of epilepsy, 
combining signal processing with neural network interpretability. This experience sparked my broader interest in how 
data-driven models can meaningfully impact healthcare. Over time, I became increasingly motivated to translate these 
computational insights into real-world clinical applications—leading me toward the field of precision medicine. In 
my postdoctoral research, I now apply similar methodological rigor to cancer datasets, aiming to improve patient 
stratification and treatment selection through machine learning.

My research focuses on using machine learning and deep learning to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical 
cancer data. I build models that learn predictive biomarkers from experimental datasets—such as cell lines and 
organoids—and evaluate how well these models can guide treatment decisions for real patients. 

Ultimately, my goal is to help build a future where every patient receives therapy tailored to their individual 
biology, not based on trial-and-error, but guided by data. By connecting the lab bench and the clinic through AI, I 
aim to contribute to the long-term vision of truly personalized cancer care.
