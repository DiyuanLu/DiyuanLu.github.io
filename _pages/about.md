Hi, I’m Diyuan Lu, a postdoctoral researcher at [**Helmholtz Center Munich**](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/menden-lab), working at the intersection of machine 
learning and precision medicine with [A/Prof. Michael P. Menden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1048557-michael-menden).

During my PhD at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies under [Prof. Jochen Triesch](https://www.fias.science/en/life-and-neurosciences/research-groups/jochen-triesch/), I focused on developing 
machine learning methods for processing complex biosignals, such as EEG data for the **early diagnosis of epilepsy** and 
MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) for **brain tumor** classification.
This experience sparked my broader interest in how 
data-driven models can meaningfully impact healthcare. Over time, I became increasingly motivated to translate these 
computational insights into real-world clinical applications—leading me toward the field of **precision medicine**. 

In my postdoctoral research, I now apply similar methodological rigor to cancer datasets, aiming to improve patient 
stratification and treatment selection through machine learning. Particularly, I am interested in the challenge of 
bridging the gap between preclinical and clinical 
health data to enhance patient treatment design and improve outcome. I build models that learn predictive biomarkers 
from experimental datasets—such as cell lines—and evaluate how well these models can guide treatment decisions for real patients. 

Ultimately, my goal is to help build a future where every patient receives therapy tailored to their individual 
biology, not based on trial-and-error, but guided by data. By connecting the lab bench and the clinic through AI, I 
aim to contribute to the long-term vision of truly personalized medicine.
